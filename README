This is my evolving emacs configuration.  
I am using emacs 24 nightly build for OS X which includes elpa.  
Paths to common external applications have been specified to ~/.MacOSX/environment.plist

I'm not a emacs expert so I have no idea if these plugins are properly configured. 
Use at your own risk and stuff.

I have used the excellent git subtree plugin (https://github.com/apenwarr/git-subtree) to include other git repositories in the site-lisp folder making them easy to update as changes become available and/or contribute back as changes are made. 

Download, Clone, Fork or whatever into your ~/.emacs.d folder.  That's it.
